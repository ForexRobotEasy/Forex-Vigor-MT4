## Development Name

Forex Vigor MT4 is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team, a group of experienced traders and developers dedicated to creating effective and reliable trading tools.

## Code Explanation

The code provided is an example implementation of the Forex Vigor MT4 indicator. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. The primary currencies are defined using an enum named `Currencies`. The available currencies are EUR, GBP, AUD, NZD, USD, CAD, CHF, and JPY.

2. The number of currency pairs is defined using a preprocessor directive `NUM_PAIRS`, which is set to 28.

3. The number of periods for LWMA (Linear Weighted Moving Average) is defined using a preprocessor directive `NUM_PERIODS`, which is set to 14.

4. The minimum percentage difference for significance is defined using a preprocessor directive `MIN_PERCENT_DIFF`, which is set to 0.01.

5. The `OnInit` function retrieves historical and real-time data for currency pairs. It calculates the percentage difference between closing prices using LWMA and stores the results in the `percentDiff` array.

6. The `significantValues` array is populated with only the significant values from the `percentDiff` array, based on a threshold defined by `MIN_PERCENT_DIFF`.

7. The `currencyMomentum` array is populated based on the sign of the significant values. Positive values indicate an upward momentum, negative values indicate a downward momentum, and zero values indicate no significant momentum.

8. The momentum strength of each currency is calculated by summing the absolute values of significant values for each currency. The results are printed using the `Print` function.

9. The `OnDeinit` function is called when the indicator is being deactivated. It can be used for any necessary cleanup.

10. The `OnCalculate` function is the main calculation function of the indicator. It currently does not perform any calculations and returns the total number of rates.

Please note that this code is provided as an example and may need modification for proper integration into a trading system.
